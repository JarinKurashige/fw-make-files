# fw-make-files

Global make file repo for all projects being worked on

## USE

1. Store this repo anywhere acceptable on your machine
2. In whatever project you are working on, create a make file that has `include path/to//fw-make-files/[makefile_name.mk]`
   - This can be a relative or absolute path

It will work as if that make file exists at your project root!
